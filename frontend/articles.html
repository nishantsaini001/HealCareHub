                            <p class="card-text">Stretching and flexibility exercises, such as yoga or Pilates, are equally important in preventing injuries and improving mobility.

                            <p class="card-text">Exercise also plays a significant role in mental health. Regular physical activity boosts the release of endorphins, which are the bodyâ€™s natural mood elevators. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced athlete, there are many ways to get active and stay motivated. It's important to start slow, listen to your body, and gradually increase intensity as you build strength and endurance.</p>
